##  Project Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd atelier-jewels
```

### 2. Install JSON-Server (for backend):
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

### 3. Create a db.json File: Create a db.json file in the project root with the following structure:
```json
{
  "jewelries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Emerald Elegance Necklace",
      "description": "A stunning necklace with emerald gemstones.",
      "price": 10000.00,
      "image": "https://example.com/emerald-necklace.jpg",
      "category": "necklace",
      "stock": 10
    }
    // Add more products as needed
  ]
}
```

### 4. Start JSON-Server:
```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

### 5. Verify API Connection
- Ensure that your script.js uses the same API endpoint:
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:3000/jewelries';
```

### 6. Launch the Frontend
- Open the index.html file directly in your browser or run a live server:
```bash
npx live-server
```

## Folder Structure
```plain
atelier-jewels/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css        # CSS styles

â”œâ”€â”€ db.json          # JSON-Server data
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This file
```

## Key Functionalities
